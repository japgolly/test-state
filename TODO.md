* Rename Show ⇒ Display.
* Rename to testate
* Around-Invariant through coproduct that isn't consistent before/after action.


Maybe
=====
* Have .stateless called automatically in Plan/Test.
* Report user-defined `f` on failure.
* Nest invariant coproducts, display choice value in History.
* Show O and/or S on failure.
* Action to log O and/or S.
* Rename `S` for `State`. Might be confusing that it isn't the state being tested.
* JS module
* React module
